# TicTacToe
A basic TicTacToe game made in C# as a console application. In this project i was trying to get a feel for the syntax of c#. I already knew the basics of programming from C but I wanted to do a fast project.

At this point in time I still don't know how to create an application that will actually run without needing to compile in VisualStudio. So you will need to download the folder and open the Program.cs file. And run it using the VisualStudio IDE.

This is my first GitHub repository post so I don't know how everything works.

PS: Sorry for the broken english. It is my second language.
