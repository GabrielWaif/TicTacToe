# TicTacToe
A basic TicTacToe game made in C# as a console application. In this project i was trying to get a feel for the syntax of C#. I already knew the basics of programming from C but I wanted to do a fast project.

PS: Sorry for the broken english. It is my second language.

## Installation

At this point in time I still don't know how to create an application that will actually run without needing to compile in VisualStudio. So you will need to download the folder and open the Program.cs file. And run it using the VisualStudio IDE.

This is my first GitHub repository post so I don't know how everything works.

## Usage

Once you run the program the console will open showing a 3x3 grid:

The console will ask you for an input of Type int that will represent the block of the grid. Counting from left -> right / Up -> Down. The game is divided into "Jogador O" and "Jogador X" , the symbol after which the player represents the player symbol that will be added to the grid. If you enter a number of a non-valid block or already used block the console will ask you to enter a new number while still on the same Player.

When someone completes a line the game will show the winner player and ask if you want to play again:

1 - Yes / 2 - No

And that's all... :).
